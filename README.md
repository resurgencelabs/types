# types
A repository with type implementation that are currently (or forever) unavailable in Noir language.

The current types maintained by Resurgence Labs are:

1. signed integers
2. fractions


We will add more types as Noir progresses. 

Note: Since Noir is a constantly evolving and new language, there might be issues that could be discovered. Please log a bug if you find something breaking.
